## 🧠 Betting Terminology

New to betting? Here’s a quick rundown of common wager types used in the strategies above:

<a name="win"></a>
### **WIN**
- You win if your horse finishes **1st**.
- Example: $10 Win on Crupi means you collect only if Crupi wins.

<a name="place"></a>
### **PLACE**
- You win if your horse finishes **1st or 2nd**.
- Lower payout than Win, but safer.

<a name="show"></a>
### **SHOW**
- You win if your horse finishes **1st, 2nd, or 3rd**.
- Safest of the three straight bets; smallest payout.

<a name="exacta"></a>
### **EXACTA**
- You pick the **1st and 2nd place finishers in exact order**.
- Higher payout, harder to hit.
- **Box**: Covers all combinations of your picks (e.g., Horse A over Horse B **and** Horse B over Horse A).
- **Key**: One horse must finish 1st, the others can finish 2nd in any order.

<a name="trifecta"></a>
### **TRIFECTA**
- You pick the **1st, 2nd, and 3rd finishers in exact order**.
- Big payout, tough to hit.
- **Box**: Covers all combinations of your picks in the top 3.

### **Other Terms**
- **Longshot**: A horse with high odds and low expectations — but potentially high reward.
- **Exacta Box ($1)**: Includes all combos. A 3-horse box = 6 combinations = $6 total.
- **Trifecta Box ($1)**: A 3-horse box = 6 combinations ($6). A 4-horse box = 24 combinations ($24).

### **Tips:**
- Odds are listed as **5-1**, **10-1**, etc. This means you win $5 or $10 for every $1 bet (plus your original bet back).
- You can place bets at teller windows or self-service kiosks at Keeneland.
- You can also bet via apps like TwinSpires or TVG (but may require account setup in advance).
