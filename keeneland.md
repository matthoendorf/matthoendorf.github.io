## 🧠 Betting Terminology

New to betting? Here’s a quick rundown of common wager types used in the strategies above:

### 🎯 Basic Bets

<a name="win"></a>
#### **WIN**
- You win if your horse finishes **1st**.
- Example: $10 Win on Crupi means you collect only if Crupi wins.

<a name="place"></a>
#### **PLACE**
- You win if your horse finishes **1st or 2nd**.
- Lower payout than Win, but safer.

<a name="show"></a>
#### **SHOW**
- You win if your horse finishes **1st, 2nd, or 3rd**.
- Safest of the three straight bets; smallest payout.

### 🎯 Exotic Bets

<a name="exacta"></a>
#### **EXACTA (EX)**
- You pick the **1st and 2nd place finishers in exact order**.
- Higher payout, harder to hit.
- **Box**: Covers all combinations of your picks (e.g., Horse A over Horse B **and** Horse B over Horse A).
- **Key**: One horse must finish 1st, the others can finish 2nd in any order.

<a name="trifecta"></a>
#### **TRIFECTA (TRI)**
- You pick the **1st, 2nd, and 3rd finishers in exact order**.
- Big payout, tough to hit.
- **Box**: Covers all combinations of your picks in the top 3.

#### **SUPERFECTA (SUPER)**
- Pick the **top 4 finishers in exact order**.
- Very tough to hit, but can pay big.
- Can be boxed like Trifecta.

#### **SUPER HIGH FIVE (S HI 5)**
- Pick the **top 5 finishers in exact order**.
- Usually only offered in the last race.
- High risk, potentially massive reward.

### 🎯 Multi-Race Bets

#### **DAILY DOUBLE (DBL)**
- Pick the **winner of two consecutive races**.
- Example: Win Race 1 & Race 2.

#### **PICK THREE / FOUR / FIVE / SIX**
- Pick the **winner of 3, 4, 5, or 6 races in a row**.
- Can “spread” your ticket with multiple horses in each leg (increases cost).
- Huge potential payouts.

### **Other Tips:**
- Odds are listed as **5-1**, **10-1**, etc. This means you win $5 or $10 for every $1 bet (plus your original bet back).
- You can place bets at teller windows or self-service kiosks at Keeneland.
- You can also bet via apps like Keeneland Select Wagering (but may require account setup in advance).
