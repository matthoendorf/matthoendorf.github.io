## Poems

### Lavender People <small>*2025-02-21*</small>

I lit a lavender candle  
Because I smelled spoiled milk  
The new smell I couldn't handle  
I guess I'm not of the ilk  
That enjoys a lavender candle  
It gave me a headache.

### Toothache <small>*2025-02-22*</small>

I don't want this tooth  
Pull it out of my head  
The pain comes at night  
I'd rather be dead  
They put on a crown  
And cemented it down  
I'm tired of soup  
I don't want this tooth

### Golden <small>*2025-02-22*</small>

It's golden hour  
As I stand in the shower  
The sun blinds my eyes  
But it feels kind of nice  
I've been here too long  
And still haven't washed  
Would pissing be wrong?  
That notion I quashed

### Cooked <small>*2025-03-04*</small>

A person fell to the ground  
Was it drugs, alcohol, or illness?  
The room was too much sound  
I felt it wasn't my business  
But my partner told me to go  
And grab them a chair to rest  
While I lost my spot to a schmo  
This place just makes me stressed

### Sunday Prayer <small>*2025-04-06*</small>

Why can't I sleep  
I was already so close  
Why can't I sleep  
I could use a good doze  
It's already five  
Alarm rings at seven  
I'm scheduled on keys  
Please have beds in heaven
