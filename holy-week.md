### 📖 **Isaiah 53 – The Suffering Servant**

> Who has believed what he has heard from us?  
> And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?  
> For he grew up before him like a young plant,  
> and like a root out of dry ground;  
> he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,  
> and no beauty that we should desire him.  
>  
> He was despised and rejected by men,  
> a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;  
> and as one from whom men hide their faces  
> he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  
>  
> Surely he has borne our griefs  
> and carried our sorrows;  
> yet we esteemed him stricken,  
> smitten by God, and afflicted.  
>  
> But he was pierced for our transgressions;  
> he was crushed for our iniquities;  
> upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,  
> and with his wounds we are healed.  
>  
> All we like sheep have gone astray;  
> we have turned—every one—to his own way;  
> and the Lord has laid on him  
> the iniquity of us all.  
>  
> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,  
> yet he opened not his mouth;  
> like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,  
> and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,  
> so he opened not his mouth.  
>  
> By oppression and judgment he was taken away;  
> and as for his generation, who considered  
> that he was cut off out of the land of the living,  
> stricken for the transgression of my people?  
>  
> And they made his grave with the wicked  
> and with a rich man in his death,  
> although he had done no violence,  
> and there was no deceit in his mouth.

>  
> But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

> When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”  
> Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!”  
>  
> After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), “I thirst.”
