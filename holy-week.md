### 📖 **John 13:1–17 – Jesus Washes the Disciples’ Feet**

> 1 Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.  
> 2 During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,  
> 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,  
> 4 rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist.  
> 5 Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.  
> 6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, 'Lord, do you wash my feet?'  
> 7 Jesus answered him, 'What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.'  
> 8 Peter said to him, 'You shall never wash my feet.' Jesus answered him, 'If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.'  
> 9 Simon Peter said to him, 'Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!'  
> 10 Jesus said to him, 'The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.'  
> 11 For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, 'Not all of you are clean.'  
> 12 When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, 'Do you understand what I have done to you?  
> 13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.  
> 14 If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.  
> 15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.  
> 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.  
> 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.'

### 📖 **Isaiah 53 – The Suffering Servant**

> 1 Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?  
> 2 For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.
> 3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
> 4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
> 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. 
> 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. 
> 7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.
> 8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? 
> 9 And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.

### 📖 **John 19:16–30 – The Crucifixion**

> 16 So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.  
> 17 So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.  
> 18 There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. 
> 19 Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, 'Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.'
> 25 But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.  
> 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, 'Woman, behold, your son!'  
> 27 Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold, your mother!' 
> 28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), 'I thirst.'
> 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, 'It is finished,' and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit."
