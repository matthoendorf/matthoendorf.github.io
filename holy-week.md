## **Maundy Thursday**
### 🕊 Theme: Servant Love & Betrayal

Before the cross, Jesus stooped low. With basin and towel, He redefined greatness as service and love as sacrifice. Even in the face of betrayal, He chose to wash feet.

**Watch:**
- **S4E4 – *Death and Taxes***  
  *Jesus' teachings clash with the temple leadership. Judas begins turning inward.*  
- **S4E5 – *Sabbath***  
  *Jesus shares the Last Supper with His disciples as tensions peak and love takes center stage.*  
- **S1E8 – *I Am He***  
  *Jesus reveals His identity to the Samaritan woman at the well.*

### 📖 **John 13:1–17 – Jesus Washes the Disciples' Feet**

**[Online Link (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013%3A1%E2%80%9317&version=NIV)**

> <sup>1</sup> It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.

> <sup>2</sup> The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. <sup>3</sup> Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; <sup>4</sup> so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. <sup>5</sup> After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

> <sup>6</sup> He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"

> <sup>7</sup> Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."

> <sup>8</sup> "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet."

> Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."

> <sup>9</sup> "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"

> <sup>10</sup> Jesus answered, "Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." <sup>11</sup> For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.

> <sup>12</sup> When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. <sup>13</sup> "You call me ‘Teacher' and ‘Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. <sup>14</sup> Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. <sup>15</sup> I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. <sup>16</sup> Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. <sup>17</sup> Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

### 🙏 Prayer

Lord, You are the King who kneels. You see every part of me and still draw near. Teach me to love, serve, and forgive like You – even when it's undeserved.

## **Good Friday**
### ⚔️ Theme: The Cross and the Cost  

This is the day love looked like suffering. The weight of the world bore down on Jesus, and He didn't turn away. The Cross shows us the depth of our brokenness – and the even greater depth of His love.

**Watch:**
- **S4E6 – *Calm Before***  
  *Jesus prays in Gethsemane. The disciples struggle to understand. The darkness begins to fall.*  
- **S4E7 – *Devastation***  
  *Jesus is arrested, tried, and crucified. The disciples flee in despair.*  
- **S2E8 – *Beyond Mountains***  
  *Jesus prepares His followers for the cost of discipleship and the road ahead.*

### 📖 **Isaiah 53 – The Suffering Servant**

**[Online Link (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053&version=NIV)**

> <sup>1</sup> Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?

> <sup>2</sup> He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.

> He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.

> <sup>3</sup> He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.

> Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.

> <sup>4</sup> Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering,

> yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.

> <sup>5</sup> But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;

> the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.

> <sup>6</sup> We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way;

> and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

> <sup>7</sup> He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,

> and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.

> <sup>8</sup> By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested?

> For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished.

> <sup>9</sup> He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death,

> though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.

> <sup>10</sup> Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin,

> he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.

> <sup>11</sup> After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied;

> by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.

> <sup>12</sup> Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong,

> because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors.

> For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

### 📖 **John 19:16–30 – The Crucifixion**

**[Online Link (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A16%E2%80%9330&version=NIV)**

> <sup>16</sup> Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.

> So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. <sup>17</sup> Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). <sup>18</sup> There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle.

> <sup>19</sup> Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews. <sup>20</sup> Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. <sup>21</sup> The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."

> <sup>22</sup> Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."

> <sup>23</sup> When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.

> <sup>24</sup> "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it."

> This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said,

> "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment."

> So this is what the soldiers did.

> <sup>25</sup> Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <sup>26</sup> When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, here is your son," <sup>27</sup> and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.

> <sup>28</sup> Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty." <sup>29</sup> A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. <sup>30</sup> When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

## **Holy Saturday** 
### 🕯 Theme: Grief, Waiting, and Hope Deferred

The silence between Friday and Sunday is not empty – it's sacred. It's where sorrow sits and faith is stretched. Today invites us to wait with trust, even when the story feels unfinished.

**Watch:**
- **S4E8 – *To Be Continued***  
  *The disciples wrestle with grief, silence, and shattered expectations.* 
- **S3E2 – *Two by Two***  
  *The disciples are sent out on mission – an echo of hope and purpose.* 
- **S3E5 – *Clean, Part 2***  
  *Healing, resurrection, and the power of Jesus to restore what was broken.*

### 📖 **Matthew 27:57–66 – The Burial and the Tomb Sealed**

**[Online Link (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A57-66&version=NIV)**

> <sup>57</sup> As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <sup>58</sup> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. <sup>59</sup> Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <sup>60</sup> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. <sup>61</sup> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.

> <sup>62</sup> The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. <sup>63</sup> "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.' <sup>64</sup> So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."

> <sup>65</sup> "Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how." <sup>66</sup> So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

**[Online Link (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations%203%3A25%E2%80%9326&version=NIV)**

> <sup>25</sup> The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;

> <sup>26</sup> it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.

## **Easter Sunday** 
### ✨ Theme: Resurrection and New Life

The stone is rolled away. Death has lost. Jesus is alive – and so are we. Today isn't just about celebration – it's about transformation. Resurrection is not just what happened; it's what's happening.

**Watch:**
- **S2E1 – *Thunder***  
  *John reflects on the beginning. Jesus calls James and John, and prepares them for mission.*  
- **S3E1 – *Homecoming***  
  *Disciples return from their mission. Jesus shares a joyful meal and reveals the next steps.*  
- **S1E7 – *Invitations***  
  *Nicodemus meets Jesus by night. "You must be born again."*

### 📖 **Matthew 28:1–10 – The Resurrection**

**[Online Link (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A1-10&version=NIV)**

> <sup>1</sup> After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.

> <sup>2</sup> There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. <sup>3</sup> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. <sup>4</sup> The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

> <sup>5</sup> The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. <sup>6</sup> He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. <sup>7</sup> Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."

> <sup>8</sup> So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. <sup>9</sup> Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. <sup>10</sup> Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

### 📖 **Romans 6:4–11 – Alive in Christ**

**[Online Link (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A4%E2%80%9311%20&version=NIV)**

> <sup>4</sup> We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.

> <sup>5</sup> For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. <sup>6</sup> For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with,[a] that we should no longer be slaves to sin— <sup>7</sup> because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.

> <sup>8</sup> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. <sup>9</sup> For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. <sup>10 The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.

> <sup>11</sup> In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
