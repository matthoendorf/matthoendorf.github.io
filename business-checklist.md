## 🚨 Immediate Next Steps

If you're just getting started, prioritize these actions in the first few days:

- [ ] **Check your state’s cottage food laws** ([Ohio Info](https://agri.ohio.gov/programs/food-safety/resources/food-programs/cottage-food)) to confirm your products are allowed.
- [ ] **Decide on your business structure** (General Partnership for simplicity, or LLC for liability protection).
- [ ] **Draft a basic partnership agreement** outlining responsibilities and profit split.
- [ ] **Apply for a Vendor’s License** through your county auditor (required for sales in Ohio).
- [ ] **Open a business bank account** to separate finances immediately.
- [ ] **Begin tracking all income and expenses** from day one, even if it's just a shared spreadsheet.
- [ ] **Start a simple shared folder (e.g., Google Drive)** to organize receipts, photos, branding, and documents.
- [ ] **Purchase liability insurance** or get quotes — especially if selling publicly or at events.

Once these are underway, return to the rest of this guide to build out your full operations.
