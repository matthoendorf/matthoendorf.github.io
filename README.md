Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! This repository is used to host a personal or project site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Getting Started

To view the site live, visit:
[https://matthoendorf.github.io](https://matthoendorf.github.io)

## How it Works

GitHub Pages allows you to serve static content (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Markdown) directly from your GitHub repository.

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone or create your repository.
2. Add your site content (HTML, Markdown, etc.).
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Go to the **Settings** of the repository.
5. Scroll to the **Pages** section.
6. Choose a source branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`) and optionally a folder (`/root` or `/docs`).
7. Save, and your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:
- Add a `CNAME` file in the root with your domain name.
- Configure your DNS to point to GitHub Pages' IPs.
